# AudioFiltering
Audio Spectral Analysis and Filtering using MATLAB

1-Using FFT to obtain the magnitude spectrum of the audio file and plotting it against frequency and using the function ‘fftshift’ to make the zero frequency in the center of the plot to see the music's frequency and noise frequency. 

2-Design a filter using ‘filter Designer’ in MATLAB to create a filter passing only the music’s frequency and removing the unwanted noise.

3-Filter Specifications: (based on noise in audio file)

Response Type	:Low Pass Filter

Design Method	: Butterworth

Sampling Frequency:	48000 Hz

Passband Edge	: 2000 Hz

Stopband Edge	: 2500 Hz

Apass in dB 	:    1

Astop in dB	  :   80

(EXPORT FILTER AS OBJECT)


4- apply the filter to the audio file to remove the unwanted frequency
